### [](#header-3)ME202-Advanced Mechanics of Solids

##### [](#header-5)Course Objectives:

1.  To impart concepts of stress and strain analyses in a solid.
2.  To study the methodologies in theory of elasticity at a basic level.
3.  To acquaint with the solution of advanced bending problems.
4.  To get familiar with energy methods for solving structural mechanics problems.

##### [](#header-5)Syllabus:

Introduction, concepts of stress, equations of equilibrium, strain components, strain-displacement relations,compatibility conditions, constitutive relations, boundary conditions, 2D problems in elasticity, Airy's stress function method, unsymmetrical bending of straight beams, bending of curved beams, shear center, energy methods in elasticity, torsion of non-circular solid shafts, torsion of thin walled tubes.

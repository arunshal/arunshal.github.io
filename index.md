Greetings,

I am working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at College of Engineering Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala. 

This page is created to share course materials ie. notes, presentations, homeworks/tutorials etc to students. In the current academic year (2017-2018), I teach **ME202-Advanced Mechanics of Solids** and **HS300-Principles of Management**. I also handle the laboratory course **ME232-Thermal Engineering Lab***

I mainly work in Computational Fluid Flow and Heat transfer. My other areas of interest are  Classical & Statistical Thermodynamics, Contunnumm physics, Mechatronics & Robotics,  Applied mathematics etc.

In my leisure time, I sketch (on Paper or on Computer), programme (C, C++ or Python) and play Violin.  

Regards,

Arun

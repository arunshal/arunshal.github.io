Greetings,

I am working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at College of Engineering Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala. 

This page is created to share course materials ie. notes, presentations, homeworks/tutorials etc to students. In the current academic year (2017-2018), I teach [ME202-Advanced Mechanics of Solids](page-1) and [HS300-Principles of Management](page-2)
